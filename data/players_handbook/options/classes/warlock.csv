Fey Presence,Action,"Starting at 1st level, your patron bestows upon you the ability to project the beguiling and fearsome presence of the fey. As an action, you can cause each creature in a 10-foot cube originating from you to make a Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell save DC.

Eldritch Invocations,Passive,"In your study of occult lore, you have unearthed Eldritch Invocations, fragments of forbidden knowledge that imbue you with an abiding magical ability. At 2nd level, you gain two eldritch invocations of your choice. When you gain certain warlock levels, you gain additional invocations of your choice, as shown in the Invocations Known column of the Warlock table.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest."

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest."
Mystic Arcanum,Passive,"At 11th level, your patron bestows upon you a magical secret called an arcanum. Choose one 6th-level spell from the warlock spell list as this arcanum.

At higher levels, you gain more warlock spells of your choice that can be cast in this way: one 7th-level spell at 13th level, one 8th-level spell at 15th level, and one 9th-level spell at 17th level. You regain all uses of your Mystic Arcanum when you finish a long rest."

Dark Delirium,Action,"Starting at 14th level, you can plunge a creature into an illusory realm. As an action, choose a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you. It must make a Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell save DC. On a failed save, it is charmed or frightened by you (your choice) for 1 minute or until your concentration is broken (as if you are concentrating on a spell). This effect ends early if the creature takes any damage. Until this illusion ends, the creature thinks it is lost in a misty realm, the appearance of which you choose. The creature can see and hear only itself, you, and the illusion. You must finish a short or long rest before you can use this feature again."
Hurl Through Hell,Passive,"Starting at 14th level, when you hit a creature with an attack, you can use this feature to instantly transport the target through the lower planes.

Create Thrall,Action,"At 14th level, you gain the ability to infect a humanoid's mind with the alien magic of your patron. You can use your action to touch an incapacitated humanoid.

You can communicate telepathically with the charmed creature as long as the two of you are on the same plane of existence."
Eldritch Master,Passive,"At 20th level, you can draw on your inner reserve of mystical power while entreating your patron to regain expended spell slots.
